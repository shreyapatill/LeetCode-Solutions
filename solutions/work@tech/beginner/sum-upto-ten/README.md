## Problem Description

Write a program to print the **sum of the first 10 numbers** (1-10).

## Constraints

- **Execution Time Limit**: 1 second  
- **Memory Limit**: 256 MB  

Since the task involves a fixed calculation with no input, the constraints do not impact the logic.

## Solution

We calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a simple arithmetic formula.

- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)**  
  The computation is done in constant time.

- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**  
  Only a single variable is used to store the result.

Using the arithmetic series formula is the most efficient method for calculating the sum of a consecutive sequence of numbers. It avoids the need for loops or additional data structures, ensuring minimal resource usage.

### Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10
    cout << (11 * 5);
    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases

- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  g++ work@tech-sum-upto-ten-beginner.cpp -o sum_upto_ten
  ./sum_upto_ten
  ```
  
- **Output**:
  ```
  55
  ```
