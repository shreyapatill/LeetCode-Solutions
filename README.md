# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository. Here you will find my solutions to various LeetCode problems, categorized by difficulty.

## Structure

- `solutions/` contains directories for each problem, organized by difficulty.
- Each problem directory includes:
  - `solution.py`: The Python solution.
  - `test_solution.py`: Test cases for the solution.
  - `README.md`: A detailed walkthrough of the problem and solution.

## File Naming Convention

To maintain clarity and consistency, the files are named following this convention:

- Solution Script: `<problem-number>-<problem-name>-<difficulty>.py`
  - Example: `0001-two-sum-easy.py`
- Test Script: `test_<problem-number>-<problem-name>-<difficulty>.py`
  - Example: `test_0001-two-sum-easy.py`
- Problem Description (README): `README.md`
  - This file is inside a directory specific to the problem, which includes the problem number and name.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired problem directory.
3. Run the solution script or test script.
